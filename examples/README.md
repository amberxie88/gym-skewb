# Examples and Training

## Using the Environment

For a quick example of how to interact with the environment, check ```play.py```

## Baselines

For training: ```python3 baselines/trainBaselines.py```

For evaluation: ```python3 baselines/runBaselines.py```

## Stable Baselines

For training: ```python3 baselines/train.py```

For evaluation: ```python3 baselines/run.py```

Currently, the stable baselines model has reached a 70% solve rate on three-move scrambles after ~2 hours of training.
