# Skewb Representation

The Skewb representation is implemented in
```
skewb.py
```

Basic tests for correct implementation of the Skewb are in 
```
test.py
```

## Skewb Representation
The Skewb is represented as six arrays of colors. Each side has five pieces, and the following image describes the index in each array for each piece.

The four unique turns (R, L, U, F) are implemented; all others are derivations of these four.
